Below is a “plain-English tour” of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` you posted.
Think of the file as a recipe that tells GitLab what to do every time you push code.

---

## 1. The very top — what machine will run the jobs?

```yaml
image: google/cloud-sdk:latest
```

* Every job runs **inside** this Docker image, which already has the Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`) installed.
* That saves you from installing the CLI in every step.

---

## 2. The list of high-level steps (called *stages*)

```yaml
stages:
  - checkout   # grab the code
  - build      # build & push the Docker image
  - deploy     # deploy to Kubernetes (GKE)
```

GitLab always executes the stages in this order: **checkout → build → deploy**.

---

## 3. Handy variables reused everywhere

```yaml
variables:
  PROJECT_ID: "gen-lang-client-0729539659"   # your GCP project
  REGION: "us-central1"                      # where your cluster lives
  REPO: "llmops-repo"                        # Artifact Registry repo name
  REGISTRY: "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev"     # Artifact Registry domain
  CLUSTER: "llmops"                          # GKE cluster name
```

You can reference any of these later with `$VARIABLE_NAME`, keeping the file short and editable.

---

## 4. Stage 1 — `checkout_code`

```yaml
checkout_code:
  stage: checkout
  script:
    - echo "Code Checked out.."
```

* ❗️**What it really does**: Nothing special—just prints a message.
* 📝 Usually you’d let GitLab’s built-in “Checkout” happen automatically and skip this job entirely, but it doesn’t hurt.

---

## 5. Stage 2 — `build_docker_image`

```yaml
build_docker_image:
  stage: build
  services:
    - name: docker:dind
      command: ["--tls=false"]
```

### Why a *service*?

* `docker:dind` = **Docker-in-Docker**.
* Lets you run `docker build` **inside the pipeline container**.

### Extra variables to talk to that service

```yaml
variables:
  DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2375        # talk to the dind daemon
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""                # disable TLS (simplifies auth)
```

### `before_script` — log in to Google Cloud

```bash
echo "$GCP_SA_KEY" | base64 -d > key.json   # decode the JSON key from GitLab CI variable
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=key.json
gcloud auth configure-docker $REGISTRY      # let Docker push to Artifact Registry
```

> **Where does `$GCP_SA_KEY` come from?**
> You store your service-account key (Base64-encoded) in GitLab → Settings → CI/CD → *Variables*.

### `script` — build & push the image

```bash
docker build -t $REGISTRY/$PROJECT_ID/$REPO/llmops-app:latest .
docker push  $REGISTRY/$PROJECT_ID/$REPO/llmops-app:latest
```

1. **Build** the container from your `Dockerfile`.
2. **Push** it to Google Artifact Registry so Kubernetes can pull it later.

---

## 6. Stage 3 — `deploy_to_gke`

```yaml
deploy_to_gke:
  stage: deploy
```

`before_script` repeats the same Google login steps (so this job is also authenticated).

### `script` — talk to your GKE cluster and deploy

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER \
        --region $REGION --project $PROJECT_ID
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-deployment.yaml
```

1. **`get-credentials`** pulls the cluster’s credentials into `~/.kube/config`, so `kubectl` can talk to it.
2. **`kubectl apply …`** sends (or updates) your app’s Deployment, Service, etc., using the YAML file in your repo.

After this, GKE notices the image tag `:latest` has a new digest, pulls it from Artifact Registry, and rolls out the new Pods.

---

### How the pipeline feels in real life

1. **Push code** → GitLab starts the pipeline.
2. **Checkout** stage passes (almost instant).
3. **Build** stage builds your image (\~1–5 min) and pushes it.
4. **Deploy** stage tells Kubernetes to use the new image (seconds).
5. GKE handles rolling updates automatically.
